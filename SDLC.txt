SDLC 
=====
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.

It is a process adopt by IT industries to develop accurate and quality of softwares.

We have six phases in SDLC.

1) Feasibility study 

2) Analysis 

3) Designing 

4) Coding 

5) Testing 

6) Delivery and Maintainence



1) Feasibility study 
--------------------
Feasibility study completely depends upon TELOS formulea.
ex:
	T - Technical Feasibility 
	E - Economical Feasibility 
	L - Legal Feasibility 
	O - Operational Feasibility 
	S - Schedule Feasibility 

All the above information they will keep in a document called BDD.

BDD stands for Business Designed Document.



2) Analysis 
--------------
In this phase, System analyst or product owner will involved.

They will seperate system requirements and software requirments.

They will keep above information in a document called SRS.

SRS stands for Software Requirement Specification.


3) Designing 
-------------
We have two types of designing.

i) High level designing 
-----------------------
A manager is responsible to perform high level designing.

In high level designing we will design main/major modules.


ii) Low level designing 
----------------------
A team lead or project lead is responsible to perform low level designing.

In low level designing we will design child/sub modules modules.

All the above information they will keep in a document called PDD/TDD.

PDD stands for Project Design Document.
TDD stands for Techical Design Document.


4) Coding
-------------
In coding phase, developers will involved.

They are responsible to generate the build(code).

Later they are responsible to perform unit testing.


5) Testing 
-----------
In testing phase, Testing Team or QA Team will involved.

They are responsible to perform to make project as bug free by using one software component called STLC.

STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle.

We have three types of testing.

i) Manual Testing 

ii) Automation Testing 

iii) Selenium Testing 


6) Delivery and Maintainence
--------------------------
Before delivery they will perform UAT testing.

UAT stands for User Acceptance Testing.

It is divided into two types.

i) Alpha testing 

ii) Beta testing
