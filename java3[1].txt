Comments in java
================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

It is highly recommanded to use comments in our regular programming.

Diagram: java3.1

Comments will not display in output because they won't compiled by the compiler.

In java , we have two types of comments.

1) Single Line Comment 
-------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 

2) Multiple Line Comment
------------------------
	It is used to comment multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			- comment here 
			-
		*/


ex:
---
//class declaration 
class Test
{

	//main method 
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		//variable declaration 
		int x = 10;

		//output stmt 
		System.out.println(x);
	}
}

Q) What is the difference between JDK, JRE and JVM ?

JDK
====
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.

It is a installable software which consist of Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), compiler (javac), interpreter (java), an archiever (.jar) , documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed for java application development.

JRE
====
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
It provides very good environment to run java applications only.

JVM
====
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
JVM is an interpreter which is used to execute our program line by line procedure.
